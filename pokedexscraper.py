#                                                     UNOFFICIAL POKEDEX (NAME PENDING)                                   #
# Welcome to the unofficial pokedex, a joint project consisting of Pradyu and Meekyle. The aim for this project was to    #
# create an online, interactive pokedex, putting our Python and web development skills to the test (two things that       #
# we focused on heavily in the first semester of university). This Python script's main purpose is to collect             #
# all the information necessary to create a pokedex. And, as the saying goes, why put in hard labour for a day to         #
# collect said information when you could automate it within a week? This Python script scrapes the Pokemondb.net         #
# website to gather the necessary information, and when we are done curating the data, we will write it to a file         #
# which we will then use as a "database" of sorts for our interactive pokedex.                                            #
#                                                                                                                         #
# We sincerely hope you enjoy this project. There will definitely be more to come from both parties in the future.        #
