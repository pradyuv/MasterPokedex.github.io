            <h1>WHO WE ARE</h1>
            <p>Hello, my name is Meekyle Mondal and I am a software engineering student at the University of Ottawa. I love coding and the world
                of computing, taking on various projects to better immerse myself with the wonders of technology. I'm currently a really big fan
                of web development and anything front-end related, but I don't mind working on the backend either.
                <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/meekyle-mondal/" target="_blank">This</a> is my LinkedIn,
                and you can find some more projects that I've worked on <a href="https://github.com/amond049" target="_blank">here</a>.
            </p>
            <p>Hi! My name is Pradyu Vasudev and I am also a software engineering student at the University of Ottawa. I love problem solving in general and coding offers me
                yet another way to solve problems. I love doing projects that interest me such as this Pokedex project, since Pokemon was always near and dear to my heart, I combined
                it with my desire to make a side project with coding. Currently, I enjoy doing back-end operations on a website and writing the base off of which a website functions.
                I don't mind working on the front-end, however using Python to web scrape on this project was really fun and a great experience. I am eager to learn more back-end technologies,
                such as Django and databases like MySQL. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/pradyu-vasudev/" target="_blank">This</a> is my LinkedIn, and I also have another project I have done
                with JavaScript on my Github page <a href="https://github.com/pradyuv?tab=repositories">here</a>, and future projects will also be posted here.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div id="bts">
            <h1>HOW IT WORKS</h1>
            <p>Before we discuss how it was all possible, we would first like to distinguish that Pradyu took on all the backend
                functionalities, and Meekyle focused on the front-end application. This was a really fun project to work on together!
            </p>
            <!-- YOU CAN PUT YOUR INFO IN HERE PRADYU -->
            <p>After having gotten the information from the web scraper and writing it all to a txt file (which we considered a
                pseudo-database for the website), it was a matter of writing JS code to get the text from the file. This is where the XMLHTTP
                Request came into play, but by no means was it trivial to implement. XMLHTTP Requests only work for valid web servers, and
                localhost is not one of these valid web servers. The only way to test and see if the code was working was to push it to the 
                Github repository and wait for the Github Pages to update. It took a bit of time to adjust to, but we got used to it. After
                successfully retrieving the file's contents, it was a matter of formatting it into data that actually had some meaning (as it 
                was just raw text before that point). With the help of the .split() method and A LOT of string indexing, the data in the txt file 
                was finally in a format that was usable by Javascript. Then it was just a matter of populating a dictionary, with the key being the 
                pokemon's name and the values being the data retrieved for each pokemon. Then all that needed to be done was to display the data 
                in a visually appealing way, and that's that.
